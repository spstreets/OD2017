The goal of this repo is to host code for the analysis of OD data from the 2017 household travel survey in Sao Paulo.
The data has the following structure.

```{r}
# unzip(zipfile = "~/hd/data/project-data/spshared/OD2017.zip", exdir = "~/hd/data/project-data/spshared/")
load("~/hd/data/project-data/spshared/OD2017.rda") # loads a OD_2017_v1
```

```{r}
OD_2017_v1 %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()
```
